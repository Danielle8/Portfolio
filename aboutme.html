       <h4>About Me</h4>

       <h3>Girls Who Code Reflections</h3>
        <p style="font-size:120%;"> Some differences between Python and Scratch is that Scratch is way more simple and straightforward, but when using Python there is much more room for error and mistakes. What is similar about both of these programs is that you as the user can add inputs and commands to then be performed.</p>
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> How I felt about having to constantly debug my system was equal parts frustration and equal parts determination but once I finally got it to work it was very satisfying.</p> 
    <p> </p>
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> Today I learned about circuits and LED lights. One obstacle was confused about what the button does and how it works. </p>
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> Robotics: After talking about robots and their ethics today my understanding of them changed because i now know how complicated they are and how much work are actually put into them. What makes me excited about the future robotics is that they can be used to help improve our world and our lives for the better. What makes me nervous about the future for robotics is how they will soon replace most things - like driving for example - and it is going to limit the amount of daily tasks we are doing. What also makes me nervous about the future of robotics is the possibility of malfunctions and them having issues and bugs like the technoglogy in our age has, like cell phones and laptops for example. What worked well in working in groups today was having different point of views and different perspectives when trying to work out an issue. Also, if someone was confused about something there is likely someone else in that group that can clarify it for them and explain it to them. What I personally can do better next time is speaking up and contributing into the discussions more than I did today. Also if I was confused about something I would ask next time or research it.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> Today I learned the difference between input and output and the fact that we can make the robots move based off of where they were and if they were touching a wall or not. And also if it was touching a wall, then we could make it move to wherever we chose, which I thought was pretty cool especially since we worked so well together.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> One thing that I learned about the internet today is that for example if you were to send an email then the email would be seperated into different packets of information and travel through different paths to get to where they were sent to, where the computer will finally reassemble the packets of information.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> Based off of the definition of LaTeX I would have to say that it is not a markup language and it is definitely a programming language because it has nothing to do with designing of the website and more to do with the coding behind it.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> The dynamic feature that I would like to learn more about would have to be the syntax of Atom and becoming more fluent in it. What I would like to add to my django site in the future is more interaction between the user and the website and having more complex fonts to make my website more appealing.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> July 26, 2017 - What I would like to add to my Django site is more dynamic features so that again, there is more interaction with the user and the site, much more information, and i nice title with my name.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> July 28, 2017 - What makes computers good at data is the way that they organize them. They use different data structures that organizes them in the most simplest and easiet way possible. You would use a dictionary instead of a list when you have multiple fields of information and with a list theres just one set of information. For example you would use a dictionary if you wanted to list the ingredients needed for a recipes, the key would be the ingredient and the value would be the amount. And you would use a list to list out the instructions because there are no specific values needed. The similarities between list and and dictionary are they are a way to store data and one difference is that one is more specific than the other.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> July 31, 2017 - What I am most proud of figuring out today is figuring out what ray tracing is and searching an assorted list using a binary search. The algorithm that was most interesting to me was the Page Rank algorithm which was named after Larry Page that basically sorts the links of a google search by order of importance. I thought this was interesting because i have always wondered how google sorts their links. The hardest thing about today was looking up the definition of what our group's algorithm was and trying to understand it.
