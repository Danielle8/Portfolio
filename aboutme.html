       <h4>About Me</h4>
       <p style="font-size:130%;"> My name is Danielle Crevecoeur and I am from Stamford, Connecticut. I am 16 years old and I go to Westhill High School. I have an older bother, an older sister, a twin sister, and a younger sister. I was born on January 8, 2001. My likes include volleyball, shopping, cooking, fashion, math and art. My dislikes include washing dishes and being stressed out. One Fun Fact about me is that my middle name is Sidney.</p>

       <h3>Girls Who Code Reflections</h3>
        <p style="font-size:120%;"> Some differences between Python and Scratch is that Scratch is way more simple and straightforward, but when using Python there is much more room for error and mistakes. What is similar about both of these programs is that you as the user can add inputs and commands to then be performed.</p>
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> How I felt about having to constantly debug my system was equal parts frustration and equal parts determination but once I finally got it to work it was very satisfying.</p> 
    <p> </p>
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> Today I learned about circuits and LED lights. One obstacle was that I was confused about what the button does and how it works. </p>
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> Robotics: After talking about robots and their ethics today my understanding of them changed because I now know how complicated they are and how much work is actually put into them. What makes me excited about the future of robotics is that they can be used to help improve our world and our lives for the better. What makes me nervous about the future for robotics is that they will soon replace most things, like driving for example, and it is going to limit the amount of daily tasks we are doing. What also makes me nervous about the future of robotics is the possibility of malfunctions and the possibility of them having issues and bugs like the technoglogy in our age has, like cell phones and laptops, for example. What worked well about working in groups today was having different point of views and different perspectives when trying to work out an issue. Also, if someone was confused about something it was likely that someone else in that group that can clarify it for them and explain it to them. What I personally can do better next time is speaking up and contributing into the discussions more than I did today. Also if I was confused about something, next time I would ask about it or research it.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> Today I learned the difference between input and output and the fact that we can make the robots move based off of where they were and if they were touching a wall or not. And also if it was touching a wall, then we could make it move to wherever we chose, which I thought was pretty cool especially since we worked so well together in our group.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> One thing that I learned about the internet today is that if you were to send an email, then the email would be seperated into different packets of information and travel through different paths to get to where they were sent to, where the computer will finally reassemble the packets of information.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> Based off of the definition of LaTeX I would have to say that it is not a markup language and it is definitely a programming language because it has nothing to do with the designing of the website and more to do with the coding behind it.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> The dynamic feature that I would like to learn more about would have to be the syntax of Atom and becoming more fluent with it. What I would like to add to my django site in the future is more interaction between the user and the website and having more complex fonts to make my website more appealing.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> July 26, 2017 - What I would like to add to my Django site is more dynamic features so that again, there is more interaction with the user and the site, much more information, and a nice title with my name.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> July 28, 2017 - What makes computers good at data is the way that they organize them. They use different data structures that organizes them in the most simplest and easiet way possible. You would use a dictionary instead of a list when you have multiple fields of information and with a list there is just one set of information. For example you would use a dictionary if you wanted to list the ingredients needed for a recipes, the key would be the ingredient and the value would be the amount. And you would use a list to list out the instructions because there are no specific values needed. A similarity between a list and dictionary is that they are both a way to store data and one difference is that one is more specific than the other.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> July 31, 2017 - What I am most proud of figuring out today is figuring out what ray tracing is and searching an assorted list using a binary search. The algorithm that was most interesting to me was the Page Rank algorithm which was named after Larry Page that basically sorts the links of a google search by order of importance. I thought this was interesting because I have always wondered how google sorts their links. The hardest thing about today was looking up the definition of what our group's algorithm was and trying to understand it.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> August 3, 2017 - Some of the limitations that me and my partner experienced included not knowing the exact syntax that related to what we wanted to do and also understanding exactly what each of the lines meant. A feature that would be interesting to add would be a password and a confirm password function that would return a message if the second password typed was spelt wrong.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> August 3, 2017 - What I am most proud of figuring out today is some of the syntax used for Python because that has been an area that I have been confused with for awhile. What I am most excited about for the final projects is being able to see the amazing ideas, including one of mine, get executed into an actual project. I am especially excited for the fact that we will have time to program an entire project and design one too.
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> August 8, 2017 - Our team is diving up the work by Sisi and myself writing up all of the questions and options to them, Tiana made a list of stores, Djesnie made an outline of the home page, and Amanda created the code for the 'About Us' page. The way that we chose to split up the work was by everyone choosing what they wanted to do and it worked out perfectly. I will ensure that I complete my tasks by constanstly checking our Kanban chart. 
    <p style="font-size:120%;"> August 14, 2017 - The benefit that our project will have for its user is helping them find stores that they would like to shop at and make their shopping experiences easier. The problems that are project might have for its users is giving accurate results. What we have done to minimize these problems is making the questions accurate so that they poduce accurate results.
